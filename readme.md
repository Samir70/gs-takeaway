# Takeaway

Quark has found a way back to communicate with the 21st Century, and is determined to make profit from  Humans who want to taste futuristic cuisine.

To make your order:
 - clone this repo
 - install ruby (if you don't already have it)
 - run_takeaway.rb has the code your taste buds are waiting for

 > ruby run_takeaway.rb 

 Make your selection, place your order and await delivery.

 (A small delivery charge will be applied, but where else are you going to get food from all over the galaxy?).

 Report any bugs to the chef.
